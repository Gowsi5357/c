Problem Statement:
Pooja would like to withdraw X $US from an ATM. The cash machine will only accept the transaction if X is a multiple of 5, and Pooja's account balance has enough cash to perform the withdrawal transaction (including bank charges).
For each successful withdrawal, the bank charges 0.50 $US. Calculate Pooja's account balance after an attempted transaction.

Input:
- Two integers X and Y, where X is the withdrawal amount and Y is the initial account balance.

Output:
- Output the account balance after the transaction.

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int withdrawal;
    float balance;

    scanf("%d %f", &withdrawal, &balance);

    if (withdrawal % 5 == 0 && (withdrawal + 0.50) <= balance) {
        balance -= (withdrawal + 0.50);
    }

    printf("%.2f\n", balance);

    return 0;
}
